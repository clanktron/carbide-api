# Pipeline Database API 

longterm goal is to leverage that API and build a UI where users could things like:
- see what versions of RKE2 are in the secured registry
- validate the images in the registry are signed and when they were lasted trivy scanned
- download a pre-compiled tarball for a specific release of a product
